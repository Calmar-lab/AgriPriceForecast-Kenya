    "### Business Overview\n",
    "Economic and livelihood concerns are critical issues in Kenya, impacting a substantial portion of the population. The agricultural sector, which is a major contributor to Kenya's economy, faces numerous challenges, including price volatility, market inefficiencies, and fluctuating public sentiment. These issues directly affect farmers' and traders' livelihoods, making it essential to develop data-driven solutions to address these concerns.\n"

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Kenya's agricultural markets are characterized by significant price fluctuations across different regions and commodities. Factors such as seasonal variations, market demand, and public perception contribute to these fluctuations. For instance, maize prices can vary dramatically based on the time of year and the region, impacting farmers' decisions on when and where to sell their produce. Additionally, public sentiment, as expressed on social media platforms like Twitter, can influence market dynamics, further complicating the decision-making process for stakeholders.\n"

    "### Main Objective\n",
    "Develop a comprehensive system that leverages advanced data science techniques to analyze and forecast commodity prices, monitor market trends, and incorporate sentiment analysis. This system aims to provide actionable insights to farmers, traders, and policymakers, enabling informed decisions and improving market efficiency and stability. Time series forecasting will be achieved through graphical analysis. Regression analysis and sentiment analysis will play critical roles in predicting commodity prices and understanding public sentiment, respectively, thereby enhancing the overall accuracy and relevance of market predictions.\n"
